# Chat Application SignalR ðŸ’¬

**The task was:**

It should be a client-server application (or two independent applications: server and index.html file with some scripting) written in any language and hosted somewhere (localhost is OK too).

User should be able to choose his name, change it anytime, and post any text message to the chat.

Do not store messages on the server.
Use web sockets to connect to the server and get and send messages to other users.
